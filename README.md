Built a web application that allows fans to immerse themselves into a) the world of their favorite player if they are familiar with the CFL or b) have the choice to be matched with a player based of the commonality of personal information if they are new to the CFL. Used cosine-similarity (Machine Learning) to produce a list of top 5 most similar players to the fan based on given sign-up input data (alma matter, hometown, etc).

Languages/Frameworks: 
Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery 
Back-end: Parse API, Node.js, Python, Flask, Heroku (RESTful API)
Data Analysis: Cosine Similarity 
Libraries: Various CFL .csv's and GeoPy
